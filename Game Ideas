Game Ideas:

1. Pac-Man: The player plays as a ghost trying to trap Pac-Man in a changing maze. Pac-Man is controlled by an AI that tries to escape. 
Design AI for Pac-Man and implement a system for generating and modifying the maze.

2. Flappy-Bird: The player is constantly chased by another bird that shoots projectiles or creates obstacles. The bird gets faster and more aggressive over time. 
Chasing bird AI that adjusts its speed and aggression based on the performance of the player. Obstacle placement generation.

3. Tetris: Instead of clearing lines, the goal is to build a stable tower. Pieces have different weights and physics, and the tower must remain balanced as it grows. 
Implementing the physical properties of the blocks. Tower collapse logic - poorly balance towers collapse or shifts.

4. Breakout: Each time the ball hits a brick, it splits into two smaller balls. The player must manage multiple balls on the screen at once while still aiming to destroy bricks. 
Ball cloning - implement a system that splits the balls in two when it hits the bricks and ensure all balls are tracked. Collisions - ensure all balls interact correctly with bricks, paddels etc. without glitches.

5. Pong/Breakout: Players defend their side (similar to normal Pong) while aiming to break through a wall of bricks behind the opponent's paddle. The first player to break through wins. 
Uses two game mechanics (Pong and Breakout)
