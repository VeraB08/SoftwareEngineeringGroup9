Game Ideas:

1. Pac-Man: The player plays as a ghost trying to trap Pac-Man in a changing maze. Pac-Man is controlled by an AI that tries to escape. 
Design AI for Pac-Man and implement a system for generating and modifying the maze.

2. Flappy-Bird: Replace the bird with a fish navigating underwater obstacles, such as seaweed, coral, and rock formations. 
Stimulate underwater environment and fish movement. Generate underwater obstacles. 

3. Tetris: Instead of clearing lines, the goal is to build a stable tower. Pieces have different weights and physics, and the tower must remain balanced as it grows. 
Implementing the physical properties of the blocks. Tower collapse logic - poorly balance towers collapse or shifts.

4. Breakout: Each time the ball hits a brick, it splits into two smaller balls. The player must manage multiple balls on the screen at once while still aiming to destroy bricks. 
Ball cloning - implement a system that splits the balls in two when it hits the bricks and ensure all balls are tracked. Collisions - ensure all balls interact correctly with bricks, paddels etc. without glitches.

5. Pong/Breakout: Players defend their side (similar to normal Pong) while aiming to break through a wall of bricks behind the opponent's paddle. The first player to break through wins. 
Uses two game mechanics (Pong and Breakout)
